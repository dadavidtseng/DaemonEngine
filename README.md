#include "Engine/Renderer/Renderer.hpp"
#include "Engine/Audio/AudioSystem.hpp"

// Initialize core systems
g_theRenderer = new Renderer();
g_theAudio = new AudioSystem();
g_theEventSystem = new EventSystem();

// Game loop
while (isRunning) {
    g_theRenderer->BeginFrame();
    // Your game logic here
    g_theRenderer->EndFrame();
}
```

// Sprite rendering with advanced features
g_theRenderer->BindTexture(spriteTexture);
g_theRenderer->DrawSprite(position, scale, rotation, tint);

// Batch rendering for performance
g_theRenderer->BeginSpriteBatch();
for (auto& sprite : sprites) {
    g_theRenderer->DrawSpriteBatched(sprite);
